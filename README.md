Aamks is a linux platform for assesing fire safety of humans in buildings. It
runs hundreds or thousands of fire simulations (CFAST) and evacuation
simulations (a-evac) and then evaluates the results.

The master branch is by no means guaranteed to work. You need to wait for a
release if you want to use it.
